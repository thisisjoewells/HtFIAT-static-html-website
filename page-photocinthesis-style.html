<h4>Converting still photographs to motion picture cinema</h4>
<p><em>How How To Feel In America Today</em> was created using an experimental cinema process that we developed and are calling 'Photocinthesis'.</p>
<p>The film was shot entirely on digital still cameras (Digital SLRs).   The process is a blend of traditional cinematography, stop-frame  animation, and photographic slide show.  The short film is 35 minutes  long.</p>

<p>The short film still maintains most aspects of a traditional  narrative film, and the viewer should have no trouble adjusting their senses.</p>
<p>We chose this process for many reasons:</p>
	<ul>
    	<li>We wanted the motion-picture to have a surreal, poetic feel to it.</li>
        <li>The process freed us from some of the technical constraints of  traditional filmmaking.  The pursuit of achieving perfect tracking shots  and crystal-clear audio in the field can become a huge distraction.   This process allowed us to focus on the story and acting in a way we  would not have otherwise been able to.</li>
        <li>We wanted to test the limits of editing and juxtaposition as the  primary means to tell a story.  We were curious to see what would happen  if freed from special effects, sync-sound, and even traditional  frame-rates/motion.</li>
        <li>We were not pleased with the quality of many of the high-definition  video formats available to us. We wanted the visual aesthetics of film  with no compromises.  We also wanted the experience of working within a  workflow similar to those using chemical film stocks and digital  intermediates.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Ironically, just a few days after the completion of principal  photography the first Digital SLR cameras were announced that feature  the ability to shoot high-definition video.  Although this is an  interesting development, this would not yield the stylistic aesthetics  we desired.</p>
